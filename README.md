# Random-password-generator
A random password generator page, which generates a random password of a certain length (between 8 and 128 characters) which contains a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters depending on the users choice.

## Challenges
The first problem i encountered was putting in the values for the numeric variable as numbers as opposed to strings.
I also encountered difficulties pushing the individual values of a selected character type into a new array. After extensive research and trial and error, i managed to find out that i needed to use the for loop to iterate through a given array to push its indivdual values one at a time into a new array.
